### For Next Time

#### Readings:

This is a lot of reading - you don't need to read every word of these, but familiarize yourself with the terms **Progressive Enhancement**, **separation of concerns**, and **semantics**. These topics have been around of a while, but in the age of JS web apps, they are very hot topics.

* [Dao of Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/dao) - from 2000?! This article is a classic.

Next time we'll be talking about semantics, or how to name make our HTML meaningful and reusable. There were a couple of Smashing articles a while ago that debated this, and caused a stir.

Look at these in order:

1. [Semantic code: What? Why? How?](http://boagworld.com/dev/semantic-code-what-why-how/) and [Wikipedia Semtantic HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)
2. [Our Pointless Pursuit of Semantic Value](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/11/our-pointless-pursuit-of-semantic-value/) - Divya Manian
3. [Pursuing Semantic Value](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/12/pursuing-semantic-value/) - response to the above, Jeremy Keith

Progressive enhancement and the 'separation of concerns' come into play here as well:

* [On Progressive Enhancement](http://notlaura.com/progressive-enhancement/) - by me!
* [Understanding Progressive Enhancement](http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement)
* [Progressive Enhancement: Itâ€™s About the Content](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/progressive-enhancement-its-about-the-content)
* [Websites vs. Webapps](http://css-tricks.com/poll-results-sites-vs-apps/) - CSS-Tricks

#### To do:

* Spend some time on Assignment 1. Bring questions for next time.
