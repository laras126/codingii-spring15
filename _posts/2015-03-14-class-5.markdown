## The Plan

Look at links.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Discuss:</span> Readings

* What's a framework, and why use one?
* What are the pros and cons of using a framework?
* When should you use it?

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Demo:</span> Floats Exercise

* Anyone want to present what they did for the blocks?
* Code it together, discuss classes and where clearfixes go.

#### Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Grids and Frameworks

* Look at 1140 grid
* Recreate layout in Bootstrap, make it responsive

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Independent:</span> Work on a Bootstrap site

* Download the starter files
* Get started with the grid together
* Add some content, play around with class based styling
* I'll come around for 1-on-1 Q/A and to discuss final projects
