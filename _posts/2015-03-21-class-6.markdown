## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Discuss:</span> Any particular questions?

* Review floats and grids, demo any questions.

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Work Time:</span> Assignments and Final Projects

* Catch up on assignments, 1-on-1 help.
* I'll come around to everyone individually to discuss final projects and come up with a game plan.
* Get started on said game plan!

#### Break

Keep working, or discuss WordPress? If WordPress:

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> Child themes and best practices

* Quick look at the Dashboard
* Themes and best practices
* What is a child theme?
	* Demo making one
	* style.css and functions.php
* Talk about development workflow, e.g. installing a local server - can help

### For Next Time

#### Readings:

* [Shay Howe Lesson 6 (of Advanced HTML/CSS): jQuery](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/jquery/)

#### Todo:

* Continue working on Assignment 2.
* **Last opportunity to turn in Assignment 1**, must be completed before the next class.
* Collect content for final project, continue working on what we started today - note: it's easy to put this off since it's not a structured exercise...don't do it! Email me if you aren't sure what to do next.
