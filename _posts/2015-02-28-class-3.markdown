* Write semantic markup for a profile page together, content first.

#### Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Lecture:</span> Naming Things is Hard

* Why is how you name things important? Creating reusable code.
* Talk about the debate
* A pattern for naming classes, other options:
	* BEM
	* OOCSS
	* SMACSS
	* A mix
* When to use IDs (hint: pretty much never)
* Presentational class names

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Pair:</span> Back to profile page
