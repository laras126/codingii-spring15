### For Next Time

Next class we'll be setting up hosting and uploading our sites to the web. Use the links below for my referral code!

* Purchase domain name ($10/year) - I recommend using [NameCheap](http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=85284)
* Sign up for hosting ($8/mo) - I recommend either [Lithium Hosting](http://lithiumhosting.com/billing/aff.php?aff=479) ($1.95-$8.95/mo - recommend $6.95 plan) or [Webfaction](https://www.webfaction.com/?aid=73790) ($9.50/mo - has more developer functionality, slightly more expensive).
