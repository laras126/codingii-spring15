## The Plan

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Discuss:</span> Responsive Design

* What is mobile first?
* How does this relate back to the idea of Progressive Enhancement?

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Demo:</span> Assignment 1 Q/A

* Anything in particular?
* Review classes and reusing classes

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Pair:</span> Floats exercise

* [Download these files](http://stuff.notlaura.com/downloads/layout-exercise)
* Start together by adding some markup and initial layout in the media query

#### Break

#### <span class="post-title-pre">Together:</span> Profile page

* Add layout to the profile page (emailed the files if you need them)
